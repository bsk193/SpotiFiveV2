# SpotiFiveV2

hi everybody, recently decided i wanted to revamp one of my old projects, (Spotifive)[https://github.com/vecchiotom/SpotiFive]. This has been completely Re-Written from the ground up. it's now also much much easier to run it, thanks to the new packaged form, so that it will be shipped as an EXE file.


### This is all still very much experimental, any help is appreciated!!!
